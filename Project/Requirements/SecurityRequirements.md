**Security Requirements**

The security requirements are as follows:
  
  · User input needs to be validated to make sure it matches what the program is asking for

      o Inform the user of the program’s desired input and how to enter it via the command line
      
      o If user input does not match the program’s needs, prompt the user to try the input again
      
      o Do not accept the required input until the user has entered the input correctly

  · No access to class data attributes

    o Will be handled by the coding process
    
    o Make class data attributes private within class
