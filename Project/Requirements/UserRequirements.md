User Requirements

The user’s expectations are as follows:


· A main.py Python file that will run the application through the PyCharm command line

· The game needs to go from start to end without major problems or performance issues

· The game needs instructions on how the game works (ex. press one to “attack”)

· The game needs to be relatively simple—nothing too complicated

· The game needs a win/loss condition, and the user needs to know if they achieved it

· The game needs to offer multiple choices to the player depending on the location/event

· The game needs to have consistently random outcomes of events and choices (i.e., using D20 dice simulation)

· Try & catch exception handling for bad user input

· Documentation of the development process
