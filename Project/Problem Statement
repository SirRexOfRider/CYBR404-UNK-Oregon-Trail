The University Of Kearney is getting tired of people not being able to find their way accross campus (especially Adam)! To help this, Adam enlists
top grade Software Engineers to help make an "educational" map around campus. To make sure people want to interact with this map, the group decides
to make a video game to both teach and entertain those at UNK.

We plan on making an Orgeon Trail-esque text based adventure game that takes place at UNK, utilizing locations and entities found here on campus.
There is also a plan to incorporate elements of DND because why not?!
We also plan on keeping this relatively simple (cough cough *Braxton cough cough) and plan on having it done within the next 3 weeks.
