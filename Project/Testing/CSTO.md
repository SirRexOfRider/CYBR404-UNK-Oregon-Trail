# 6.1 Code and Security Testing Overview

In our project, we will need to complete testing on user inputs to make sure that the user is entering valid input that will not break the system. Specifically, we will want to test putting text in instead of integers, as well as input that is not any of the allowable input to see how the system handles the input. 

We also want to make sure that depending on what time of incorrect input is taken in, there is an appropriate message that addresses the specific issue and gives instructions to fix the problem. Otherwise, if there is a generic error message given, the user might not know how to fix the issue to continue through the game. The user getting stuck in the game is, clearly, sub-optimal, and may lead to rage quitting. 

Specifically, final tests will need to assess the following:

### String Input Assessments

-	Does string input break the program? 
-	Does string input get an appropriate error message? 
-	Does corrections to input result in getting stuck in a while loop, or is the user able to continue the game?

### Integer Input Assessments

- Does incorrect integer input break the program?
- Does incorrect integer input get an appropriate error message? 
- Does corrections to input result in getting stuck in a while loop, or is the user able to continue the game? 

### Float Input Assessments

- Does float input break the program? 
-	Does float input get an appropriate error message? 
-	Does corrections to input result in getting stuck in a while loop, or is the user able to continue the game?
