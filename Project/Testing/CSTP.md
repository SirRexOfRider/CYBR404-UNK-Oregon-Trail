-	Verify that error message is correct and tells the user how to fix the problem
-	Verify that user is able to continue through the game once incorrect input is fixed 

### Integer Input Tests

-	Enter incorrect integer input into all input slots
-	Verify that error message is correct and tells the user how to fix the problem
-	Verify that user is able to continue through the game once incorrect input is fixed
