As with any new project, there’s always the question: What is the point? Or why do we need this? What problem could this be solving? While the world is full of problems, there is a reoccurring one that many a software engineer has tried to solve before: absolute boredom. Pure boredom is the problem that our game, A Nifty, Dungeons and Dragons-esque, Oregon Trail-esque, Survive the Day at UNK Game™, attempts to solve. With the results of player choices changing every time the game is opened, our game gives the opportunity for new and interesting playthroughs over and over again, retaining player attention and keeping boredom at bay. So, never fear – A Nifty, Dungeons and Dragons-esque, Oregon Trail-esque, Survive the Day at UNK Game™ is here.
