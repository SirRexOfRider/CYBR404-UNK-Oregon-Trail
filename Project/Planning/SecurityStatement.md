**Security Statement**

The two main security concerns with our program will be user input and access to data attributes in classes.

Regarding user input, all user input will be validated appropriately to ensure that it cannot break the program. Validation of user input will take into account whether the user should be inputting string or integer input, as well as whether or not it matches allowed choices. The user will be given a message letting them know if they have entered inappropriate data, as well as instructions on how to fix their input.


With data attributes in classes, all created data attributes will be made private from the start so that they cannot be accessed outside of the class. By building privatized data attributes directly into our coding style, this will protect data attributes from being malformed from outside the class.
