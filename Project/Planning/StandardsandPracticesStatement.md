**Standards and Practices Statement**

•	**Formatting variables**
-	Variables should be formatted using meaningful names related to what they represent.
-	Ex. data = 0, inventory = [], etc.
  
•	**Functions**
-	Functions should be verb-driven to represent what the function is doing for the overall program.
-	Functions should use meaningful names that clearly designate what they are do.
-	ex. print_welcome
  
•	**Modules**
-	Module calls may be shortened to the first letter of the module as long as the new alias is clearly defined at the top of the file for easy readability.
  
•	**Classes**
-	Headers for data attributes, init, getters, setters, and to string 
-	Instances printed out using first letter and numbering system
-	All data attributes will be made private
-	Headers will exist for each element in the class
-	Ex. for first instance of Pet class, use p1 = Pet()
  
•	**Programming languages** 
-	The programming language that will be used is Python via the PyCharm IDE. No other programming language will be utilized in this project. As a result, all items below should utilize snake case naming conventions where applicable.
