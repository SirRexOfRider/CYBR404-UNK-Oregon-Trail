**Outcome Summary**

We expect to have a fully functional and repeatable game coded within python. It will have user input from the command line and that will be verified to prevent the game from ever breaking from bad user input. We expect that this game will incorporate elements of games like the Oregon Trail and Dungeons and Dragons within the code and gameplay loop. We also expect that this product will be mostly completed if not fully completed with coordinated efforts from the team within three weeks. We will have documentation of all the steps of the Waterfall SDLC as well as diagrams to help illustrate what the code looks like (Problem Frame/DFD/etc.) We will also expect to learn about the Software Development Life Cycle and how projects in a team setting should be done effectively.
