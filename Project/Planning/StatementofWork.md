**•	Project objectives**
Our project objective is to create a choose-your-own adventure style game using PyCharm on command line. The project will implement user input validation to keep the program from crashing as it receives user inputs to determine player choices in the game. Our overall goal is to create a fun product that users will enjoy and be able to play over and over again.t
  
**•	Scope**
Our project will be built and playable through PyCharm on the command line. The program will take in user input to make choices on the command line based on specified options provided in a menu given to the user on the command line. The game will operate within a while loop that will be able to be exited at any time by the user using the applicable key given to the user on the before-mentioned menu. An if/elif/else structure will be constructed inside of the while loop to guide the program through options based on the player’s choices. The Random module in PyCharm will be used for varying game play with choices and results, as well as a D20 dice simulation for the final battle against the Loper dragon. A rudimentary inventory system using a list/array will be implemented for the player to collect items to use to fight the Loper dragon at the end of the game to save the professor.


We decided not to use several different elements for the sake of time, since this project will only last three weeks. Specifically, while GUIs are pretty standard with packaged, executable games, for the sake of time, our game will only be playable on PyCharm’s command line. Additionally, we decided to only have one big fight at the end of the game instead of allowing to the player to pick a fight with random NPCs they run into. Finally, instead of using a fuller range of dice like in actual Dungeons and Dragons, our game will only utilize a D20.
  
•	**Expectations upon completion** 
-	User will be able to start game from command line
-	User will be able to exit game at any point
-	User will be able to make choices that will have random results depending on what’s generated from the Random module
-	User will not be able to break program with bad user input 
-	Dying will take the user back to the top of gameplay 
-	Items collected will be stored and accessible from a list/array 
-	Surviving the game will end gameplay with a “You won!” message
