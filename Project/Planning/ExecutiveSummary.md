**Problem**
As with any new project, there’s always the question: What is the point? Or why do we need this? What problem could this be solving? While the world is full of problems, there is a reoccurring one that many a software engineer has tried to solve before: absolute boredom. Pure boredom is the problem that our game, A Nifty, Dungeons and Dragons-esque, Oregon Trail-esque, Survive the Day at UNK Game™, attempts to solve. With the results of player choices changing every time the game is opened, our game gives the opportunity for new and interesting playthroughs over and over again, retaining player attention and keeping boredom at bay. So, never fear – A Nifty, Dungeons and Dragons-esque, Oregon Trail-esque, Survive the Day at UNK Game™ is here.
  
**Process**
The process to solve the problem will involve creating an engaging video game that keeps players absorbed, boredom forgotten. If players are busy playing the game, they will soon forget they were bored.

**Proposed Solution**
Our proposed solution to do this is to create a Dungeons and Dragons, Oregon Trail-style choose-your-own-adventure game using random outcomes to allow for prolonged replay value. Allowing for varied outcomes will create a desire in players to play again to see how things could have ended differently.

**Expected deliverables**
Our expected deliverable is a command line game run in PyCharm using the Random module that allows a player to traverse a (potentially, but most likely treacherous) day at UNK to try and make it to CYBR 404 and save Professor Adam Spanier from a newly unearthed Loper dragon. The game will include a crude inventory system that will allow the player to collect items along the way, as well as the ability to access a D20 style dice at the finale to fight the Loper dragon and save Adam.
