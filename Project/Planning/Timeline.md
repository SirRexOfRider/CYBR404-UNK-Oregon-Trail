For our timeline, we plan on having due dates for certain steps to be achieved during the projects completion. There is a lot of "jiggle room" with due dates which is why some due dates overlap or others seem far off. The goal is to work on these steps whenever we can get to them, but have a defined dates for when they are due so the project can keep going forward.

The graph of our current timeline resides in the Planning folder, or can be found using this link:
