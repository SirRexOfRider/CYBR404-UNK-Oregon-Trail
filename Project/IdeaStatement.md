# Idea Statement
The name of our project is A Nifty, Dungeons and Dragons-esque, Oregon Trail-esque, Survive the Day at UNK Game™. Our project is envisioned as an Oregon Trail-style choose-your-own adventure game where the user traverses a day in the life at UNK and tries to survive different obstacles. The game will be coded using Python and relevant Python libraries such as Random. Because of time constraints, the game will take place on the command line instead of using a GUI. The user will start out at UNK’s arch with the goal of reaching Adam Spanier’s CYBR 404: Systems and Software Engineering course without dying. As the user progresses, they will be offered different choices that can have different results each playthrough utilizing random numbers. For example, going to the Graze might result in a tasty meal, or the player could get dysentery, which would “kill” the character and force them to start over. Players will make chooses using command line inputs. Input validation will be in place to make sure that player input is valid. Once the player reaches CYBR 404, they will find out that Adam has been kidnapped by a Loper dragon, which the player must battle in order to save the day and win the game. At this point, new options will appear for the player, with options to access items previously in a rudimentary inventory system consisting of a list/array, as well as a simulation of a D20 dice using Random in order to see if actions will succeed. Each item chosen from the inventory to fight with will have its own chosen actions that can be used to fight. If no item is chosen from the inventory to fight with, there will be a base fight ability. If the player wins, they will be given a “You won!” message on the command line. Otherwise, if the player dies, they will end up again at the beginning of the game just like any other time they would die. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e39349-e3fd-46a0-8a4b-f1b7c13e5c39)
